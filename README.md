## Before install

I have used src/db.json file for dummy DB for products list and running the same with json-server to act as backend for fetch.

Once downloaded,
Just Run 
terminal one:
```bash
C:\Users\User Name\demo>  npm i
``` 

```bash
C:\Users\User Name\demo>  npm start
```
and to dummy json server run,
New terminal -2:
```bash
C:\Users\User Name\demo>  npx json-server --watch src/db.json --port 8000
```
